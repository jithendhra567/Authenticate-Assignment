## state management

- I used context api only
- This project doesn't have a complex state to manage. which can be managed easily with context api itself.
- This project is designed and followed open/close principle, so without changing any code you can create store file for redux and integrate easily

## Concepts used

- Component with hooks (custom Hooks)
- Datamanagement with provider (context)
- Custom Elements (p, input, button... etc)
- SOLID Principles
